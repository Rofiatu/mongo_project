Thw aim of this project was to try my hands on noSQL with a focus on MongoDB.

In this project, I obtained a sample json sales data from Kaggle and imported into my mongo db. Afterwards, I did the following:

- Attempted to query my db to obtain certain KPIs (primary purpose of this was to be able to validate the correctness of the file imported into Tableau for visualisation)
- Downloaded the sales document from my db in json format
- Converted the json file to csv
- Imported csv into Tableau to create a dashboard
- You can find my tableau dashboard at the link here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rofiatu/viz/sales_data_17201175666190/Dashboard
